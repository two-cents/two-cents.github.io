            About</p>

                <li class="ttu">Feedback</li>
                <ul class="fw2">
                    <li>The idea of asking 10 friends for feedback all at once was easier and less time consuming than asking them separately.</li>
                    <li>Other Slack groups were too large and self-serving</li>
                    <li>Dribbble wasn’t being used for feedback like it used to.</li>
                    <li>There was a need for a small community of trusted eyes.</li>
                </ul>
                <li class="ttu">Friendship</li>
                <ul class="fw2">
                    <li>Yearlong Community</li>
                    Conferences and workshops are great, but when you leave, sometimes you miss out on that community until the next year. We wanted to create a place where community was rooted in in person experiences, but grew during times that we were separate from each other.
                    <li>Sharing Life</li>
                    Working in house or freelance can get lonely. Sometimes, it’s just enough to know that there are some other people right there with you in the process. There’s comfort in shared struggles and shared victories.

            FAQs</p>
        <p  class="f3">
            Can I join the original Two Cents chapter? 
        </p><p  class="f3 fw2">
            No. And not because we’re mean or exclusive but because the magic of a small community is that it is capped at a certain number. We’ve learned that the smaller, the better. There are plenty of talented people out there waiting to be a part of your group.
